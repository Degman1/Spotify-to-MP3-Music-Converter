# Spotify-to-MP3-Music-Converter
A text based application to download songs specified by a spotify playlist off of youtube into MP3 format.

Credit to the creator of https://github.com/brentvollebregt/spotify-playlist-downloader.git for inspiration for this project and the foundation for the downloading method.

# Usage
1. Run the SpotifyDownloader executable
2. Use the help command for a guide to how to work the system

TIP: Click the three dots at the top of a playlist (on the desktop version of Spotify), click share, and click "Copy Spotify URI" to retrieve the playlist's URI.

To update youtube_dl, run: sudo pip install -U youtube-dl

If youtube_dl is out of date, the song downloading commands will likely fail.
