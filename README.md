# Spotify-to-MP3-Music-Converter
A text based application to download songs specified by a spotify playlist off of youtube into MP3 format.

Credit to the creator of https://github.com/brentvollebregt/spotify-playlist-downloader.git for inspiration for this project and the foundation for the downloading method.

# Usage
1. Run the SpotifyDownloader executable
2. Use the help command for a guide to how to work the system

TIP: Get the URI of a Spotify playlist by clicking the three dots at the top (on the desktop version of Spotify) and click share. In this sub-menu, click "Copy Spotify URI". This will copy the URI to your clipboard.

To update youtube_dl, run: sudo pip install -U youtube-dl
If youtube_dl is out of date, the song downloading commands will likely fail.
